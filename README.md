You will be creating a NaiÌˆve Bayes (NB) classifier, which reads in a document and assigns a topic label to the document.
You are going to train and test your classifier on discussion-board messages which were collected from online forums.
The document topic is one of the followings:
(1) Cars/Sports(2) Politics(3) Science(4) Computers
After reviewing the theoretical concepts (task-0), you will first annotate a small collection of documents to get 
familiar with the data and the challenges of text categorization (task-1). You then implement a preprocessing module 
to tokenize the text (task-2). You continue by implementing the training and test modules of the NB algorithm (task-3). 
You also implement a simple module to evaluate your classifier (task-4). Finally, you train, test, and evaluate your classifier
with the provided dataset, with the experimental setup.
